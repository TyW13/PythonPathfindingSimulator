Pathfinding Simulator

Created using Python and Pyside6 library

A small application where the user can place start, end and obstacle nodes on a square-based grid. The shortest path available (avoiding the obstacles) will be calculated and displayed, starting at the start node and going all the way to the end node (if the path is doable). The user also has the option to enable/disable the displaying of the pathfinding process that the algorithm takes by toggling the "Show Progress" box. The progress shown is which nodes have been added to the open and closed sets during the pathfinding process. A nice explaination is available in a video created by Youtuber Sebastian Lague called " A* Pathfinding (E01: algorithm explanation) "

Currently only one algorithm is available, A*/AStar, but more are soon to come!

I created this project as a way for me to practice, remind myself and display what I had previously learnt about pathfinding algorithms and also as a way to more familierise myself with the Python programming language and libraries that can be associated with it.
